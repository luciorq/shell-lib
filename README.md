This repository includes a library of shell functions that are intended to
be used as part of other Shell Scripting software development projects
or used interactively as shell functions sourced from an interactive Shell.

> **Some functions require Bash Shell v4.4 or newer.**

The file `lib/force-xdg-basedirs.sh` actually don't follow the standards
of this library.
This file is intended to be sourced from an interactive session to force some
applications to abide by the XDG Base Directory Specification.
